![Paul and Matt in Wing Yip, Birmingham](http://www.raz.me.uk/private/wingyip-matt.png)

In June 2008:

* [Beth][beth] finished her Open University course and [booked her flights](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/29885.html) for her round-the-world adventure, with the intention to [leave in January](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/30159.html).

* In a very political month, [Bryn][bryn] argued against the [proposed new powers](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/06/11/the-answer-to-everything/) of the police to detain suspects of terror offenses for longer periods, and then [followed up](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/06/12/the-fallout-from-42-days/) by asking if the new rules might help terrorists more than they'd hinder them, looked at the possibility of [Ireland voting against EU expansion](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/06/13/the-man-from-dublin-he-says-no/), and asked why the Government [can't keep bits of paper safe](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/06/17/government-data-breach/).

* [Claire][claire] looked forward to [being awareded her MEng](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/06/claire-q-meng/), and described herself as becoming like an engineer as well as a scientist, watched [a bizarre twist](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/06/is-there-anything-more-bizarre/) on The Weakest Link, and played a lot of [Guitar Hero III](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/06/oh-so-responsible/).

* [Dan][dan] dreamed that he was [watching a film about dreaming](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/01/vanilla-sky-a-letter-and-a-trip/), played [Ninja Burger RPG](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/06/enter-the-ninja/), watched his [beer breathing](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/13/breathing/), downloaded [Firefox 3](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/18/firefox-3-download-day/), had a revelation about [talking about suicide](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/23/talking-suicide/), moped about [being misquoted](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/25/oh-to-be-quoted-correctly/), expressed concern at [ICANN](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/27/icann-invent-a-whole-universe-of-mess/) permitting generic TLDs, and shared [a bumper sticker](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/06/28/eat-berthas-mussels/) that seemed to be a long way from home.

* [Jimmy][jimmy] planed [the rest of his trip](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/30912.html) for when he left New Zealand, [felt ill](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/31087.html) from too much bus travel before travelling to [New York](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/31416.html) and then [on to Canada](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/31526.html), and finally [back home](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/31959.html) at the end of his world tour.

* [JTA][jta] [put off housework](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/06/11/self-sufficiency-its-laziness-but-ok-ed-by-society/) so that he could spend more time playing video games, then went to his [Great Aunt Joan's funeral](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/06/20/four-train-stations-and-a-funeral/).

* [Liz][liz] was driving her car when she had [the slowest, stupidest crash ever](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/103278.html), rolling the car at just 40mph.

* [Matt P][matt-p] went through [the agreement](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/36919.html) he had to sign to get Jobseeker's Allowance, while a fellow jobseeker [accused staff](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/37136.html) of being communists, and realised that [he didn't have a social life](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/37624.html).

* [Rory][rory] went [shopping in Birmingham](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/103364.html), took a course in iPhone development, and went to a [Japanese BBQ](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/103589.html).
