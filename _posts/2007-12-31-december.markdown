* [JTA][jta] got [a new mobile phone](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/12/16/so-yeah-delayed-post-again/) and shared a dream he'd had as well as his plans to spend Christmas in Aberystwyth with [Ruth][ruth], [Dan][dan], and [Claire][claire]. Come [Boxing Day](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/12/26/boxing-day/), he'd decided that this was a good decision.

* [Liz][liz] looked forward [to Christmas and parties](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/102204.html).

* [Matt R][matt-r]'s mother [argued with carol singers](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/43249.html).
