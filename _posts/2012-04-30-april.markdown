In April 2012:

* [Adam G][adam-g] gave us poems about [vegetables](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/on-the-veg-of-reason/) and [surrealism](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/home-on-the-strange/).

* [Adam W][adam-w], wrote up more of his UK-wide grand tour, covering [Brighton](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2012/04/10/brighton-a-model-of-excellence/) and [London](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2012/04/12/london-same-old-brand-new-you/).

* [Andy R][andy-r] promoted his new album, "[The Signal and the Noise](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/new-album-2012/)".

* [Dan][dan] made [an April Fools' blog post](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/01/on-this-day-in-2040/), misseed [eating meat](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/04/meat-i-miss/) (perhaps inspired by Adam's poem), started [handling his dad's estate](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/11/personal-effects/), and [redesigned his blog](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/13/a-new-look/) (and later, explained [how he did](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/17/css-transitions/) some of it). He went on to discuss the [limited size of text messages](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/19/160/), watched [Star Wars in Machete Order](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/23/star-wars-machete-order/), abused [HTTP 301 codes](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/24/visitor-tracking-without-cookies/) to track visitors who block cookies, and reminisced about [handing in his dissertation](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/27/on-this-day-12/) eight years earlier.

* Meanwhile, [Dan][dan]'s dad - or some of him, at least - finally [made it to the North Pole](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/04/16/top-of-the-world/).

* [Paul][paul] contemplated coffee and [found himself a new house](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/04/07/pickled-coffee/). He gave a nod to [Jack Tramiel](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/04/10/jack-tramiel/), who had just died, and [almost wrote a letter](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/04/20/letter-writing/).

* [Rory][rory] dug up [some fascinating code that he wrote in the mid-90s](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/115727.html).

* [Ruth][ruth] said [goodbye to LiveJournal](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/181201.html), starting [a new blog](http://fleeblewidget.co.uk/2012/04/moving-on/) at [fleeblewidget.co.uk](http://fleeblewidget.co.uk/). [Her first real post](http://fleeblewidget.co.uk/2012/04/rearranging-ticket-fields-in-trac/) covered how to re-arrange ticket fields in [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/).
