May 2011's posts were made alongside the referendum for Alternative Vote in the UK, and the equally-important and democratic Eurovision Song Contest:

* [Adam G][adam-g] wrote poems about [holidays](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/jollydays/) and [the selfishness of suicide](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/derek-the-dickhead/).

* [Adam W][adam-w] promoted this year's [Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2011/05/10/feel-your-heart-beat/).

* [Andy R][andy-r] continued his "PWL re-issues" blog series with "[No More Roads](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/boxedset06-nmr/)".

* [Bryn][bryn] took photos of [a couple in the sun](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/05/01/sunny-couple/) and [an empty bench](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/05/18/empty-bench/).

* [Claire][claire] compared [voting systems across the world](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2011/05/voting-systems-across-the-world/) and listed her [desert island board games](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2011/05/desert-island/).

* In a busy month of blogging [Dan][dan]'s board games collection was [larger than he expected](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/01/the-board-games-are-breeding/) when he came to [packing for a house move](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/03/what-i-learned/). Later, he invented an [Alternative Vote](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/04/apples-to-alternative-vote/)-variant of Apples to Apples, raced with other [Oxford cyclists](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/06/the-race/), thanked people who [wished his dad a swift recovery](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/06/well-wishes/), ate burritos on [Cinco de Mayo](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/08/cinco-de-mayo/), worried about [necrophiliac paramedics](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/11/necrophiliac-paramedics/), had an Oxford '[blast from the past](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/12/another-crazy-connection/)' moment, discovered that [other people were also pressing the Office of National Statistics](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/13/poly-and-the-census-part-three/) on their "correction" of polyamorous relationships to monogamous ones, in the census, found ironies in the new [EU cookie legislation](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/15/leading-by-example/), was [mistaken for JTA's son](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/16/whos-your-daddy/), found [a strange billing option](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/17/every-full-moon/) from his ISP, survived [a lunchquake](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/19/disaster-analysis/), watched the [Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/21/earth-sunset/) while moving house, found the source of [Paul][paul]'s [weird music](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/23/weird-music-only-paul-likes/), suffered [a concussion](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/25/content-freeze/), injures himself while [running for cake](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/27/idiocy-repeats-itself/), and announces the [imminent death of Abnib](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/05/30/the-death-of-abnib/).

* [Ele][ele] reported that she and Lee found the [most-insulting job description](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/9181.html) they'd ever seen.

* [JTA][jta] talked about [how important](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2011/05/03/anybody-for-a-sprig-of-lilac/) the Alternative Vote referendum is, and then [continued to argue](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2011/05/08/a-genuine-question/) for it. Later, he talked about how [draining](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2011/05/25/energy-supply-weekly-hi-lo-lights/) his house move was.

* [Liz][liz] got into [a serious exercise plan](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/110312.html).

* [Paul][paul] started working in the [tobacco room](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/05/24/typical/) at Booker, went to a concert, and moved house (along with [Ruth][ruth], [Dan][dan] and [JTA][jta]). He played the Kevin Bacon game [using his mother](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/05/28/six-degrees-of-my-mother/).

* [Sian][sian] enjoyed cakes, prosecco, horses, and other [little things](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/the-little-things/). She begins to  [get the hang of crochet](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/happy-hooker/).
