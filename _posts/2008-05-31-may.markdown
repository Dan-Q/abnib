In May 2008:

* [Adam W][adam-w] prepared for the [musical and cultural event of the year](http://westyads.livejournal.com/31290.html) (the Eurovision Song Contest, of course).

* [Beth][beth] had [an interview](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/29545.html) for a possible permanent position.

* [Bryn][bryn] marked [the month of his birthday](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/05/04/lenses-elections-moving-and-getting-older/) by switching from glasses to contact lenses, by helping the Conservative party win votes (though not enough to make a difference in his constituency), and moved house.

* [Claire][claire] and [JTA][jta] [broke up](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/05/awkward-silences/).

* [Dan][dan] shared the ["Campsite Rule"](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/14/campsite/), suffered [karaoke](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/17/make-it-stop/), planned to [attend Bicon again](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/21/bicon-2008/), promoted [Abnib Quotes](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/21/abnib-quotes/), had [an unusual dream](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/28/a-cautionary-tale/), considered the [side-effects](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/29/reasons-to-tick-the-its-complicated-box/) of [Claire][claire] and [JTA][jta]'s break-up on their other romantic relationships, and wondered if [a small Japanese woman](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/31/does-food-go-missing-from-your-kitchen/) might be hiding in his kitchen.

* [Jimmy][jimmy] went to [Canberra](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/29482.html), [sold his car](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/29795.html), and arrived in [New Zealand](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/30039.html), to [climb glaciers](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/30317.html), and do a [bungee jump](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/30488.html).

* [Kit][kit] and [Fiona][fiona]'s car was [stolen](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/bloody-hell-what-a-month/); he shared news about [Chinese counterfeiters](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/irony/) and being [afraid](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/05/21/fear/) of how work and money would pan out, at home. Meanwhile, their bees [killed their queen](http://bloggingbees.livejournal.com/6638.html).

* [Liz][liz] [swallowed a fly](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/103097.html).

* [Matt P][matt-p] finally [left Aberystwyth](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/35932.html), packing his recollections of it and of other parts of his life into [memory boxes](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/36326.html).

* [Paul][paul] noted that [the Sugababes had pulled out](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/05/09/sugababes/) of the May Ball, tried a [Big Mac](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/05/12/big-mac/), and proposed a cinema trip to see [Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/05/13/indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/) on release day.

* [Pete][pete] arrived, unannounced, [back in Aberystwyth](http://loonybin345.livejournal.com/4868.html) for a visit.

* [Rory][rory] listed [all of the computers he'd owned](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/102671.html) and [played badminton](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/103121.html), among other things, with the other Aberites.
