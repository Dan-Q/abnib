* [Adam W][adam-w] talked about his plans for [his holiday](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2011/09/29/a-lorimar-holiday-production/) around the UK, followed by a [long-winded](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2011/09/29/escape-switch/) description of how the thing would work.

* [Andy R][andy-r] finished his "PWL re-issues" blog series with "[Train Songs](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/boxedset10-trainsongs/)".

* [Bryn][bryn] complained about an idea to teach children welsh, implemented via a mechanism that [would have looked out of date](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/01/arloesol-innovative/) years earlier, listened to [some audiobooks](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/04/wythnos-yma-mewn-llyfrau-llafar-this-week-in-audiobooks/), sang the praises [of Lanyrd.com](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/06/lanyrd-awesome/), listened to [some more audiobooks](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/11/wythnos-yma-mewn-llyfrau-llafar-this-week-in-audiobooks-the-thank-you-economy/), pretty-much [gave up](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/13/beth-yffach-s4c-wtf-s4c/) on S4C, and [left Facebook](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/09/26/gadael-gweplyfr-leaving-facebook/) (he later came back).

* [Dan][dan] enjoyed retracing his steps with [the back button](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/03/the-back-button/), wrote a sequel post about [open-source shaving](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/07/open-source-shaving-2/), drank a wine that looked like [it had been made for him](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/11/promisqity/), took part in [a murder mystery](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/15/a-vintage-murder/), suffered from [cluster headaches](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/22/ouch/), asked questions about [the Queen's passport](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/27/the-queens-passport/), and made [cool QR Codes](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/09/30/qr-codes-of-the-bodleian/) for a Bodleian Library exhibition.

* [Kit][kit] got a [wormery](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/wormery/) and complained that [green "targets" don't help appliance lifespans](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/white-goods/), as his and [Fiona][fiona]'s fridge packs in.

* [Matt P][matt-p] realised that now he owned a car, [he'd come to depend upon it](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/54490.html), [worked late](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/54565.html), and got [a sore back](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/54890.html).

* [Paul][paul] spent a weekend in [Mytholmroyd](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/09/01/mytholmroyd/) with [Rory][rory], [Bryn][bryn], Gareth and [Penny][penny], visiting [by coach](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/09/01/national-express/). He later [shared a blog post](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/09/07/in-defence-of-mockbusters/) by a B-movie studio.

* [Rory][rory] did [an annual update](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/112294.html), got [an i7 Mac Mini](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/112462.html) and Apple TV, and boldly declared that "[Android is dead](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/112784.html)".

* [Sian][sian] drank coffee [from an Elvis mug](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/09/27/coffee/).
