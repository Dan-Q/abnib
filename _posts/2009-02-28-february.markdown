![The third fusion plant](http://blog.scatmania.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/power-station-60-300x225.jpg)

In February 2009:

* [Andy R][andy-r] was interviewed by [Ragged Words](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/04/interview-with-ragged-words/), argued that [voting is not a sign of bravery](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/hazel-blears-throws-toys-from-pram/), discussed the [numerology of pop albums](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/numerology-and-pop-records/), started making [a series of weekly music videos](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/20-xplosion-15-films-in-15-weeks/), saw ['Anvil!'](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/anvil-stray-borders/), gawped over [the MiniOrgan](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/miniorgan/), and shared his video of ['Good Christian/Bad Christian'](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/15-films-good-christian-bad-christian/).

* [Claire][claire] argued that almost [nothing is beyond humour](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2009/02/some-things-shouldnt-be-joked-about/), and wondered whether xkcd had been [beaten to a joke](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2009/02/ive-been-modelling-statistics-for-weeks/).

* [Dan][dan] celebrated Christmas (twice) and [turned 28](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/02/06/my-last-month-and-a-bit/) with minimal fuss, asked about a proposed [meet-up in Cardiff](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/02/09/is-cardiff-still-amazing/), admired - [and then accidentally mocked](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/02/25/cerrie-burnell/) - a disabled celebrity, and aroused [Jimmy][jimmy] with a picture of [a fusion power plant](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/02/25/and-then-jimmy-came-all-over-his-pants/) (for Power Grid).

* [Jen][jen] told us all (very little) about [The 7th Generation Project](http://scleip.livejournal.com/57867.html).

* [Jimmy][jimmy] bought [a new camera](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/34934.html) and went to Paris with [Claire][claire], and tried to [give away](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/35205.html) an old computer monitor.

* [JTA][jta] processed a book [from the Bodleian](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/02/20/i-think-it-was-in-spanish/), which gave him a sense of nostalgia, and [defended himself](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/02/20/because-im-a-human-and-theres-nothing-humans-like-better-than-to-spread-their-downers-through-the-medium-of-technology/) against anti-religious attacks, leading to a long debate in the comments.

* [Matt P][matt-p] reached [the 25-30 age bracket](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/44287.html) and wished that he could have a snow day.

* [Paul][paul] spotted that [Kosovo](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2009/02/05/kosovo-now-old-enough-to-date-weekly-world-news/) was now old enough to date, and discovered [the BNP's record label](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2009/02/10/great-white/).

* [Penny][penny] felt [blissful](http://thepennyfaerie.livejournal.com/1377.html) as she looked forward to all of the great things in her future.

* [Rory][rory] travelled around [Kyoto](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/106487.html).
