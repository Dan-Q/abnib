In November 2010, [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta] got [married](http://www.r-jta.info/), which somewhat dominated the blog posts:

* [Andy R][andy-r] tried to answer [ten scientific questions](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/ten-questions-about-science/).

* [Bryn][bryn] went to [Gregynog](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/11/23/gregynog/) and to [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]'s wedding; the last in [a series](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/11/29/priodasau-weddings/) of weddings among his friends.

* [Dan][dan] reflected on [his breakup](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/01/on-this-day-5-2/) with [Claire][claire] a year previous, attended [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]'s [stag/hen weekend](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/01/r-jta-stag-hen-1/), complete with [stripper](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/02/r-jta-stag-hen-2/) and [Go Ape!](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/03/r-jta-stag-hen-3/) in costumes, which subsequently became [traditional](http://the.tradition.abnib.co.uk/). He wrote about some [erotic fiction](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/05/skinheads/) by a friend of his, suggested [a video game movie](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/08/asteroids-the-movie/), followed up on Google's work to help suicidal people [find Samaritans](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/11/googling-for-suicide-part-ii/), complained about a [Firefox feature](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/14/fx-4-tabgroup-issue/) that turned out to be a bug, and made [observations](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/17/hectic/) about [Paul][paul]. Later, he [set off](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/26/to-wedding/) for the [chaos](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/27/action-stations/) of [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]'s wedding, and [mourned](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/11/29/leslie-nielsen-was-admitted-to-hospital-earlier-this-month/) the death of [Leslie Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Nielsen).

* [Kit][kit] described [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]'s wedding as "[splendid](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/r-jta-the-21st-century-and-bits-of-the-13th/)".

* ['Malbo21'][malbo21] picked up [five pence](http://malbo21.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/5p/) from the floor.

* [Paul][paul] didn't get [a job](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/11/19/abingdon-feedback/), digitised some [old videos](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/11/20/youtube/), had [a bad experience](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/11/24/one-to-avoid/) of some opticians, [added](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/11/29/contact-me/) a [contact form](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/contact-me/) to his blog, and was [the DJ](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/11/29/one-to-attend/) at [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]'s wedding.

* [Rory][rory] shared his [2010 bests](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/111410.html) and saw [the first](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/111657.html) of what was to become a snowy winter.

* On [their wedding blog](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/), [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta] explained how the [dress code](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/11/the-dress-code-and-dont-throw-things/) at their wedding would be not-obvious, started [a competition](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/11/the-competition-or-if-this-is-one/), had problems with [make-up and favours](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/11/the-first-two-calamities/), and introduced [some ice-breakers](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/11/the-icebreakers/). [Ruth][ruth] explained why she'd be [taking JTA's surname](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/11/the-name/).

* [Sian][sian] gave us [some advice](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/im-over-there/) to read her [post on Hayley's blog](http://www.ceriselle.org/blog/2010/11/c-r-y-get-checked/) about getting our hearts checked out.
