![Andy and Sian](http://www.scatmania.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/andy-sian-e-shoot-071.jpg)

January 2010 saw [Andy][andy-r] and [Sian][sian] get married, a new style of murder mystery at [Dan][dan]'s house, and a handful of other things:

* [Andy R][andy-r] released a [free EP](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/01/03/mostly-furniture/) of instrumentals and [returned](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/back/) to music-making after taking time off to get married to [Sian][sian].

* [Beth][beth] was [diagnosed](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/32324.html) with fronto-temporal lobe epilepsy.

* [Bryn][bryn] performed [two](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/01/27/test/) [tests](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/01/29/another-test/) on his blog.

* [Dan][dan] expressed [praise for his sister](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/06/in-which-i-express-praise-for-my-sister/), got a [Nokia N900](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/16/nokia-n900/), trolled a [gas salesman](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/21/smell-of-gas/), [failed](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/23/late-for-the-altar/) to get to [Andy][andy-r] and [Sian][sian]'s wedding, fixed [SuperGenPass](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/27/supergenpass-in-microb/) for use on MicroB, and wrote a roleplaying-heavy murder mystery game: [Murder In Space!](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/01/31/murder-in-space/)

* [Fiona][fiona] [announced](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/38184.html) that she and [Kit][kit] would [come down to Aber](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/38587.html), where they learned how to [make sushi](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/38856.html).

* [JTA][jta] remarked that [2009 sucked](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/01/01/its-all-gone-wrong-hasnt-it/), launched [a wedding website](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/01/06/r-jta-exists-huzzah/) for him and [Ruth][ruth], and, after his car broke down, got [stuck in Wales](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/01/24/stuck-in-wales/) when he, [Ruth][ruth], and [Dan][dan] ought to have been at [Andy][andy-r] and [Sian][sian]'s wedding. On the wedding website, [JTA][jta] introduced [the countdown](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/01/were-getting-married/) to his marriage to [Ruth][ruth].

* [Kit][kit] talked about introducing everybody in Aberystwyth to [geocaching](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2010/01/30/trading-fossils-for-friends/), and how he misses the place (and the people).

* [Paul][paul] talked about spending [Christmas](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/01/08/boing/) with [Dan][dan]'s family, and what he'd been up to since, which mostly cosisted of [criticising The Times](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/01/11/mixed-metaphors/)' editorial standards.

* [Rory][rory] described Murder In Space as ["awesome"](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/109232.html).

* And, of course, in a blog post with no fewer than ten exclamation marks, [Sian][sian] talked about [getting married](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/nyc/) to [Andy][andy-r].
