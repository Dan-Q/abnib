* [Adam G][adam-g] wrote a poem about the people he passes [on his way to his lunch](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/lunchtime-strangers/), and blogged about [expecting a baby](http://strokeyadam.livejournal.com/79558.html)!

* [Andy R][andy-r] continued his "PWL re-issues" series with "[Tank vs. Cat](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/boxedset09-tvc/)".

* [Bryn][bryn] started a new job, and [moved to London](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/08/07/fresh-start-dechrau-newydd/), celebrated [Gareth's birthday](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/08/27/penwythnos-hir-long-weekend/), and considered [a new title](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/08/28/teitl-newydd-new-title/) for his blog.

* [Dan][dan] listed [things he'd been doing](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/01/instead-of-blogging/) instead of blogging, got [a new mobile phone](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/04/a-new-sensation/) (which he would later [complain about](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/28/whats-wrong-with-my-phone/)), announced that [he was now vegetarian](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/07/how-can-you-have-any-pudding-if-you-dont-eat-your-meat/), defended the right of bloggers [to be anonymous](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/10/my-name-is-me/), shared a photo of [a calendar at work](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/13/work-calendar-nsfw/), had his bike [stolen](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/19/wake-me-up-when-september-begins/), defined "[chronogoldfish](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/22/time/)", became [a trustee](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/25/trustee-in-me/) of a helpline, and worried about our [runaway population growth](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/31/seven-billion/).

* [JTA][jta] observed that [London Calling](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2011/08/02/huh/) was (ironically) being used to promote the Olympics, and profiled books with [awful sex scenes](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2011/08/19/john-cleland-it-aint/).

* [Liz][liz] and Simon's [wedding day](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/110798.html) came around, and [they got married](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/111058.html). [Bryn][bryn] [wrote about it](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2011/08/14/bells-clychau/), and [Dan][dan] said [a few words](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/08/15/liz-simon/) too.
