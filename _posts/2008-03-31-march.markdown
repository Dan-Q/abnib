* [Liz][liz] looked forward to [Simon moving in](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/102447.html) with her; when he did, though, he discovered that he [hated his job](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/102741.html).

* [Matt P][matt-p] continued to drift [from interview to interview](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/33563.html), learned a lot about [The Beatles](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/33873.html), visited [Cornwall](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/34109.html), and contemplated why [people relate to Christmas better than Easter](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/34311.html).
