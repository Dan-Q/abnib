In July 2008:

* [Beth][beth] was [wracked with self-doubt](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/30267.html) while hungover, the day before her new job.

* [Claire][claire] fell into her overdraft for some heavy [car expenses](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/07/for-everything-else-theres-overdraft/), then used maths to work out that it was still worth keeping the car.

* [Dan][dan] speculated that his socks were [evolving](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/07/03/the-evolution-of-socks/) like peppered moths, and videoed the [demolition of Y Tabernacle](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/07/11/demolition-of-y-tabernacle/).

* [Jen][jen] felt sad to be [leaving aberystwyth](http://scleip.livejournal.com/57276.html).

* [Jimmy][jimmy] applied for [a PhD placement](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/32048.html) and worried about his Nan, who [died](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/32415.html) about a fortnight later.

* [JTA][jta] made a first attempt at [a driving test](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/08/wot-no-extra-credit/), which didn't go as well as he'd hoped, had a strong [ascention run](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/10/ah-hell-and-i-really-thought-that-was-going-somewhere/) at NetHack, [broke](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/27/breakage/) [several](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/27/testing-testing/) [things](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/27/208/) while trying to [update his copy of WordPress](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/28/back/), did [a few quiz memes](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/28/praise-the-lord-for-mountain-dew/), received [a cheque](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/29/i-like-getting-post/) for his work [the previous week](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/29/from-old-men-to-axe-accidents-ive-been-keeping-busy/) (which was a hugely busy week accompanied by a correspondingly enormous blog post), and looked forward to [starting his new job](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/07/31/im-getting-up-in-the-morning/) so that he didn't have to continue eating only rice.

* [Liz][liz] and Simon went to [Italy](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/103515.html).

* [Matt P][matt-p] was [offered a job](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/38028.html) as an Assistant Voluntary Services Coordinator, [pending references](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/37645.html), for which he needed to [buy some shirts](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/38191.html); later he discovered that he'd be [paid significantly less](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/38482.html) than he's anticipated.

* [Matt R][matt-r] rediscovered libraries and looked into [graphology](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/46634.html) and received a confused [missed parcel card](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/47271.html).

* [Paul][paul] found [Germany's answer](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/07/13/daventry/) to Daventry.
