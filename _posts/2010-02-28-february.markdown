February 2010 was a month in which [Kit][kit] and [Fiona][fiona] visited Aberystwyth and introduced a lot of the local Abnibbers to Geocaching, which featured among many of the blog posts:

* [Andy R][andy-r] asked himself whether the [iPad is good for musicians](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/ipad-for-laptop-musician/), shared [photos](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/pictures-from-shunt-gig/) from a gig, and announced [upcoming gigs](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/02/25/gigsalbum/).

* [Bryn][bryn] took a panoramic photgraph of [snow](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/02/25/snow-by-the-a44/) by the A44.

* [Claire][claire] bought the [wrong memory](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2010/02/bad-memory/) for her new computer.

* [Dan][dan] got introduced to [Geocaching](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/02/08/geocaching/) by [Kit][kit] and [Fiona][fiona], implemented a [one-time pad](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/02/10/one-time-pad-in-javascript/) in Javascript, explained to idiots that [free software is free](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/02/17/firefox-is-free-duh/), and went to [Macclesfield](http://www.scatmania.org/2010/02/26/macclesfield/) to play board games with [Liz][liz] and Simon.

* [Fiona][fiona] invited [some friends over](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/39128.html) for board games and films, retrieved [a travel bug](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/39350.html), set herself a [sewing challenge](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/39609.html), ate [sushi](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/39849.html), attempted to ressurect a [dying computer](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/40025.html), was told off [by a cat](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/40318.html), started making a [new top](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/40512.html) and later [a skirt](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/40820.html) and [a handbag](http://fionafish.livejournal.com/40985.html) to go with it.

* [Jimmy][jimmy]'s lunar satellite was [pronounced dead](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/35897.html), so he went geocaching.

* [JTA][jta] belatedly said great things about [Murder in Space](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/02/03/belated-reports-of-murdery-goodness/), discovered the greatness of [slutty librarians](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/02/04/savage-love-best-caller-ever/), got [double-booked](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/02/06/three-things/), took part in [a survey from Orange](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/02/08/hrmm/), a learned [how to be the life of the party](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2010/02/25/486/).

* Simon [proposed](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/106682.html) to [Liz][liz], who suggested [country dancing](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/106852.html) for their wedding before the pair of them [threw a party](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/107241.html).

* [Matt P][matt-p] felt [tired, ill, and generally miffed](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/50140.html) and mentioned that Sonia had [been rushed into hospital](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/50285.html), but [came out intact](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/50573.html).

* [Paul][paul] started [planting geocaches](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/02/02/geocaching/) around Aberystwyth, then did a [23-mile hike](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2010/02/10/my-feet-hurt/) to get some of the more-rural caches between Borth and Bow Street.

* [Ruth][ruth] began [a diet](http://www.r-jta.info/blog/2010/02/the-diet/) in order to be thin in her wedding photos.

* [Sian][sian] saw [Derren Brown](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2010/02/14/stuff-i-like-sunday/), and looked back over she and [Andy][andy-r]'s [first month of marriage](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/thwedding/).
