September 2007 was the month of QParty, [Dan][dan] and [Claire][claire]'s relationship celebration party, and many blog posts made reference to that. Also:

* [Adam G][adam-g] was upset by the death of [Colin McRae](http://strokeyadam.livejournal.com/75849.html), who he felt was the greatest British sports star of all time.

* [Beth][beth] dreamed that [she was already at QParty](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/25976.html), fumed when [her evening class was cancelled](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/26311.html), and [overdid the wine](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/26542.html) at QParty and embarassed herself quite a lot.

* While buying a dress for QParty, [Claire][claire] discovered that [she owned too many shoes](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2007/09/i-have-too-many-shoes/) and received two [unusual pieces of mail](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2007/09/mysterious-package/).

* [Dan][dan] discovered that the [venue for QParty](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/03/qparty-venue/) was being rennovated just days before the event and planned [his QParty speech](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/06/qparty-speech/). 5 hours before the party was due to start, he discovered that the venue [still wasn't ready](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/08/qparty-venue-not-so-ready-as-expected/), and so a handful of the guests [pulled together](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/29/qparty-part-1-before-the-party/) to tidy up and make the place functional before the rest of them arrived. Afterwards, he shared [some initial thoughts](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/16/qparty-first-thoughts/) on how well it had gone and finally [looked back over the entire event](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/01/qparty-in-hindsight/) and shared a plethora of photos. Later in the month, he produced an [updated version](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/21/livejournal-for-google-reader-v13-update/) of his software for getting LiveJournal friends-only posts into Google Reader.

* From their QMoon, [Dan][dan] and [Claire][claire] sent virtual postcards about their time in [Venice](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/11/qmoon-virtual-postcard-1/), [Rome](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/12/qmoon-virtual-postcard-2/), [Naples](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/14/qmoon-virtual-postcard-3/) and  [Pompeii](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/09/15/qmoon-virtual-postcard-4/).

* [Jen][jen] panicked about [the essays](http://scleip.livejournal.com/56121.html) she should have finished writing.

* [Jimmy][jimmy]'s car [broke down](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/25261.html), explained [what he does](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/25357.html) at work, and looked back [on QParty](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/25607.html).

* [JTA][jta] enjoyed [QParty](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/09/10/qparty-afterword/), got stuck when his [computer broke](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/09/18/god-damn-lazy-bastard-machine/) (it came back to life by itself and he was later able to achieve [a stunning score](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/09/20/huzzah-broadly/) at NetHack), suffered from a [distressing recurring dream](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/09/24/last-night-i-dreamed-i-went-to-manderley-again%e2%80%a6/) and - despite how much he'd enjoyed Wallingford - [looked forward](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/09/24/i-actually-wrote-this-on-saturday/) to returning to Aberystwyth.

* [Kit][kit] congratulated everybody involved with [making QParty a success](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/raise-n-to-the-power-of-q/) and suggested that [banning promotions on alcohol](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/alcohol/) might be a good idea.

* [Matt R][matt-r] reported on his visit to the [Edinburgh Fringe](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/39271.html), got [stumped](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/39694.html) by a tough sudoku, watched [bad television](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/39552.html), made [puns about QParty](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/40174.html), found [his ideal career](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/40313.html) with the help of an online test, had [a fight](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/40619.html) with his sister, and researched something he saw in an [enigmatic advert](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/40731.html).

* [Paul][paul] announced the imminent sale of [Abertoir tickets](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/03/top-secret-abertoir-update/) the [mystery screening](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/05/abertoir-update/) and [schedule](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/05/abertoir-schedule/), applied to [be a milkman](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/11/neither-mann-nor-milk/), had a few adventures on the [trip back from QParty](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/11/q-party-and-pizza/), got a job working [at the Commodore Cinema](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/22/job/), and discovered a [query-by-humming](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/09/30/i-didnt-think-it-was-possible/) music search tool.
