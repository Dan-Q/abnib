In August 2007:

* [Dan][dan] lost [Jen](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/05/looking-for-jen/), got [excited](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/10/excited/) by his upcoming trips, woke up [Claire][claire] in an [unfortunate way](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/16/how-not-to-wake-up-claire/), went to [BiCon](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/16/first-night-at-bicon/), to talk about [nonmonogamy](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/18/first-day-at-bicon/), and [flogging](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/18/elementary-flogging/) and to [dress up and dance](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/19/bicon-ball/) and to eventually have [a midnight picnic under the stars](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/20/the-magic-of-bicon/) and read [really bad erotica](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/23/really-bad-erotica-for-dummies/), then went on to [Preston](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/21/preston-2/) on the way to [Edinburgh](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/23/edinburgh-fringe/) for the [Fringe Festival](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/23/edinburgh-fringe/). He [didn't see much comedy](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/24/how-not-to-watch-comedy/), though, instead spending a lot of the time there re-jiggering his and [Claire][claire]'s and [Ruth][ruth]'s and [JTA][jta]'s relationships into a complicated polyamorous quad. He suffered [an injury](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/28/a-series-of-unfortunate-injuries/) while trying to explain this new arrangement to a friend, after he and [Claire][claire] got [back to Aberystwyth](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/28/jiggerty-jig/), where he later received [a romantic gift](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/29/purple-rose/) from his new lover, read too much into [a response to a QParty invitation](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/31/sometimes-i-read-too-much-into-things/), an event for which he was still doing lots of [last-minute preparation](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/08/31/8-days-to-qparty/).

* [Hayley][hayley] was appointed the [lower school history teacher](http://leelee1983.livejournal.com/14335.html) at Kirkham Grammar School.

* [Jimmy][jimmy]'s [homebrew beer died](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/24942.html) in the same week that the Matthew's Street Festival was cancelled.

* [JTA][jta] and [Ruth][ruth] went to [Cropredy](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2007/08/08/cropredy-foreword/).

* [Liz][liz] found herself [waiting](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/101833.html) for a new place to live, a promotion, the weekend, an MSc, and a dog, all at the same time.

* [Matt R][matt-r] planned to make [strawberry vodka](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/37607.html), came up with an [idea for a show](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/37771.html), fantasised about [living in Cardiff](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/37984.html), laughed at [maths jokes](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/38343.html), spent [Sunday](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/38430.html) drinking and catching up with friends, shared [eight things](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/38820.html) you might now know about him, and made [an enigmatic post](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/39011.html).

* [Paul][paul] noted the death of [Tony Wilson](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/12/rip-tony-wilson/), planned for a [new job](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/22/work-2/) working at the Commodore Cinema, shared a recipe for [mao pao tofu](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/24/mao-pao-tofu/), advertised an Abnibbers [bonfire](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/29/bonfire-tonight/), was upset that illegal immigrants were arrested from several of [his favourite curry houses](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/31/aww-not-again/), and ripped [audio from Psychonauts](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/08/31/psychonauts/).
