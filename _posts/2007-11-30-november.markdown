![Dan, Claire, JTA and Ruth with Lloyd Kaufman](http://blog.scatmania.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/unholy-lloyd-kaufman-noredeye.jpg)

In November 2007:

* Among a string of puns, [Claire][claire] expressed concern that [she might not see Meatloaf after all](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2007/11/ill-kill-meatloaf-if-he-doesnt-come-back/), a prediction that [came true](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2007/11/notloafomglloyd/) when he suffered from vocal cysts, but instead she got to meet Lloyd Kaufman. Later, she visited Sundeep in [London](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2007/11/london/).

* [Dan][dan] ran around the country, returning to Aberystwyth just in time to [have a beer with Lloyd Kaufman](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/05/lloyd-kauffman-weekend/) alongside [Claire][claire], [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]. He and Claire went to [Gregynog](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/09/off-to-gregynog-3/), played [Quizzlecrawl](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/21/apology-troma-night-update-etc/), went on the [Real Ale Ramble](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/27/return-from-the-real-ale-ramble-and-upcoming-abnib-events/), shared [reactions](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/28/reactions-to-the-unholy-alliance/) to the polyamorous 'quad' of him, [Claire][claire], [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta], and dreamed [about his sisters](http://www.scatmania.org/2007/11/29/oh-and-my-sisters-are-black/).

* [Kit][kit] discovered a blog that [tracked Pauls Daniels' eBay activity](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2007/11/22/the-internet-and-its-wrongness/).

* [Liz][liz] moved in [with Gareth](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/102039.html) but never saw him.

* [Matt P][matt-p] finally [finished his masters dissertation](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/30001.html) and went for some [tests](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/30273.html) to see if he could potentially work for West Midlands Police.

* [Matt R][matt-r] avoided trick or treaters, [sang](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/42390.html), and shared a NewsBiscuit article about how the screenwriters' guild strike was [affecting pornos](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/42588.html).

* [Paul][paul] agreed to [do some favours for Lloyd Kaufman](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/11/05/whoops-3/), disposed of some [spare computer gear](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/11/21/spare-kit/) and [a voucher](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/11/26/fireboxcom/), and tried to [broaden his musical tastes](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2007/11/30/last/)
