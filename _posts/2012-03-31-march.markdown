He wrote about [a gun that fires tampons](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/08/the-tampon-gun/), an [interview](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/13/poly-in-the-media/) he did on the subject of polyamory, and the "[missile defence](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/15/missiles/)" at the olympic games. He also [harassed the creators](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/19/hdmi-virus-or-how-i-became-an-old-person/) of a scam computer product, discovered [an amazing whisky](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/20/douglas-of-drumlanrig/), recovered [some lost blog posts](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/21/remembering-december-2003/), claimed that [Sonicnotify would not catch on](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/23/sonicnotify/), observed [a quirk](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/25/a-damn-virgin/) in his GMail Contacts search, asked [what we can learn from RPH 'fetch quests'](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/27/fetch-quest/), and shared [the 8-bit version](http://www.scatmania.org/2012/03/31/8-bit-google-maps/) of Google Maps.

* [JTA][jta] qualified [as a Librarian](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2012/03/05/i-think-its-only-fair-to-warn-you/): a sliver of good news amongst some bad. He also [panic-bought fuel](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2012/03/29/the-fish-pies-snoek-got-it-snoek/).

* [Kit][kit] complained about [dubious pet shops](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/aquaria/) and chlorination of water.

* [Liz][liz] changed jobs and [moved down South](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/112058.html), near [Dan][dan], [Ruth][ruth], [JTA][jta], and [Paul][paul].

* [Matt P][matt-p] deconstructed [the budget](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/56468.html).

* [Paul][paul] looked at [how cool the Raspberry Pi is](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/03/08/raspberry-pi-and-chocolate-cake/), and talked about his experience of computers when he was growing up.

* [Rory][rory] built [a clock](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/115316.html), and [reviewed the iPad 3](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/115482.html).

* [Sian][sian] shared [a cute picture of herself](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/dydd-gwyl-dewi-hapus/).
