In January 2008 several Abnibbers spent a week at [West Blockhouse](http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/west-blockhouse-13044), a coastal fort in Pembrokeshire. Furthermore:

* [Adam W][adam-w] observed that [hell had frozen over](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2008/01/11/one-hundred-and-fifty-days-later/) and as such he had indeed blogged. Barely.

* [Bryn][bryn] brought his blog [back from the dead](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/01/28/its-back/) after the server it had been hosted on had failed. He opted not to restore the older posts, and as a result this is the earlist blog post indexed by this incarnation of Abnib.

* [Dan][dan] turned 27 at [a Pembrokeshire fort](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/01/09/a-very-very-short-post/) (he later put [a video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXvwfa2ah8U) showing the stairwell), and spotted that [Scotch Pete][pete] was [in town](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/01/21/scotch-pete/).

* [Jen][jen] asked if anybody could [proofread her dissertation](http://scleip.livejournal.com/56355.html) and asked everybody to [text her their numbers](http://scleip.livejournal.com/56618.html).

* [Jimmy][jimmy] got [puppies](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/25873.html), and asked [Dan][dan] to write a thorough post about the fantastic time they'd had at West Blockhouse; later, his dad was admitted to hospital following a [suspected heart attack](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/26202.html).

* [Matt P][matt-p] wished everybody a [Happy New Year](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/32235.html) and a doctor [wired him up to a machine](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/32403.html) to work out what was wrong with him.

* [Matt R][matt-r] summarised [his experience of 2007](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/43410.html), scared [a guy on the street](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/43653.html), dreamed about [the end of the world](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/43814.html) (featuring Middlesborough), was [annoyed](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/44235.html), wondered [optimistically](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/44432.html) about friends and the future, and moaned about [not having a girlfriend](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/44698.html).

* [Paul][paul] provided an [update](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/01/14/long-time-no-post/) about his work at the Commodore Cinema and at a corner shop, proposed [curry](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/01/14/curry/) after badminton, shared a recipe for [bacon vodka](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/01/27/admiral-crunch/), took photos of [a Bento box](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/01/28/bento-4/).
