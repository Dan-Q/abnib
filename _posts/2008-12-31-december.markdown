In December 2008:

* [Claire][claire] realised that she might have to use a research method called the [Q methodology](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/12/q-methodology/), which pleased her a lot.

* [Dan][dan] wasn't too busy to [go to a c√©ilidh](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/08/environmental-awareness-and-yes-im-still-busy/) with [Ruth][ruth], commented on the [Wikipedia/child porn block scandal](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/09/omg-child-pr0n-or-is-it/), installed a Christmas tree [upside-down](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/12/the-christmas-tree-is-up/), sent out a [Christmas message](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/17/smartdatas-christmas-message/) from SmartData, built ['Nena'](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/18/nena-christmas-comes-early-for-dan/), his new PC, thanked leap seconds for being able to [kiss both of his girlfriends at midnight](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/18/kissing-at-midnight/) on New Year's Eve, shared videos about [The Fife Diet](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/29/the-fife-diet-from-kamikaze-cookery/), and provided a patch to support [HttpOnly Session Cookies](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/12/29/httponly-session-cookies-using-activerecordstore-in-rails-22/) in Rails 2.2.

* [Ele][ele] visited [Aberystywth](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/7044.html) and watched *Teeth*, a terrible film.

* [Jimmy][jimmy] commented on *[Teeth](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/34671.html)*, and provided an update on his research project.

* [JTA][jta] found [a well-timed bottle](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/10/good-timing-that-bottle/) of booze, paid his [Council Tax](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/15/blimey/), suffered from [inadeqate painkillers](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/16/arrguffgh/) until he got some [better ones](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/18/decrepitude-update/), prepared to [leave town for Christmas](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/23/quick-notes/), and said goodbye to [Woolworths](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/12/27/come-to-join-us-for-the-last-waltz/).
