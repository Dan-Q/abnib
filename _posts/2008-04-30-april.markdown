![A ship in the bay](http://pics.livejournal.com/razza/pic/00002aek/s320x240)

April 2008 saw a series of blog posts by different Abnibbers on the subject of social class, and the death of *I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue* chairman Humphrey Lyttelton:

* [Adam W][adam-w] watched [Pushing Daisies](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2008/04/20/the-daisy-and-the-fuckwit/) and pre-emptively mourned the anticipated [extinction of bumble bees](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2008/04/21/bumble/), without which we wouldn't have The Deadly Bees.

* [Beth][beth] had some starlings [tattooed up her back](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/28831.html) and tried to [finish her course](http://littlegreenbeth.livejournal.com/29096.html) with the Open University. She wrote an essay on social class, too, but subsequently deleted it.

* [Bryn][bryn] mourned the death of [Humphrey Lyttleton](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/04/25/loss-of-a-legend/).

* [Claire][claire] committed to [buy no clothes](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/04/no-more-clothes-for-claire/) for a year, and, to counteract the "hippiness" of that effort, made arguments [against organic food](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/04/go-organic-except-for-chicken-milk-and-vegetables/) being all that and listed [annoying things that people do](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/04/keeping-up-appearances/) for appearances' sake.

* [Dan][dan] explained how [Google pranked him](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/01/googles-april-fool/) and how [he pranked his co-workers](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/02/my-april-fools/) this April Fools' Day, shared a comic strip [without Garfield in it](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/02/garfield-minus-garfield/), passed on [a message from Heather](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/03/bryn-and-heather/), saw [The Australian Pink Floyd Show](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/04/the-australian-pink-floyd-show/) with [Claire][claire], [Ruth][ruth], and [JTA][jta], celebrated [Paul][paul]'s birthday with a [curry](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/09/curry-and-penny/), was texted ["No."](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/13/conspiracy-no/) a lot of times, sobered up to discover he was [coding Perl](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/17/quite-a-night/), did [a grand tour](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/21/danville/) of swimming, board games, Mario Party, Steeleye Span, drinking, and music, weighed-in onm the debates on social class with [a Munchkin joke](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/23/super-munchkin/), and got [three pints from Gordon Brown](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/04/30/six-pounds-and-eighteen-pence/).

* [Ele][ele] suggested combining orders to the [Valve store](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/6012.html), travelled [to and from Aberystwyth](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/6184.html) several times, including one to see [Jimmy Carr](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/6514.html).

* [Jimmy][jimmy] hung out in [Tasmania](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/28858.html), trekking around the [East Coast](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/28994.html), and then discovered that there's [nothing to do](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/29187.html) on your second day in Canberra.

* [JTA][jta] gave his thoughts on [social class](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/04/18/well-that-came-out-sounding-rather-more-fed-up-than-id-expected-it-to/), marked the death of [Humphrey Lyttelton](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/04/26/sigh-3/), and [took apart](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/04/30/a-half-successful-week/) a washing machine that was otherwise to be scrapped.

* [Matt P][matt-p] got [some "reasonable" feedback](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/35001.html) from his interview with the police, had an away-day with a charity he was [Director (or Trustee)](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/35218.html) of, belatedly weighed in on the [debate about middle-class-ness](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/35439.html), and [ressurected](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/35675.html) a dead laptop.

* [Matt R][matt-r] changed his Facebook status to "in a relationship", which turned out to be [an April Fools' joke](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/46147.html), and was shocked, if unsurprised, by the death of [Humphrey Lyttelton](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/46493.html).

* [Paul][paul] watched Western Europe play ["whoever smelt it, dealt it"](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/04/19/odours/) and tried to work out [why Aber cinema-goers](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/04/19/cold-cinema-scrubs/) do what they do.

* [Penny][penny] said ["I love you Gareth!"](http://thepennyfaerie.livejournal.com/1163.html)

* [Pete][pete] hung out in [London](http://loonybin345.livejournal.com/4361.html) with Helen, [Ele][ele], Lee, Amy, and Will, and invited the Abnibbers out on [a picnic](http://loonybin345.livejournal.com/4653.html).

* [Rory][rory] finally [got onto Abnib](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/100611.html), which made him realise that he should blog more. He started by [watching Firefly](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/101045.html) and ate lots of food, planned a holiday in [Italy](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/101340.html), bought an [eeePC](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/101539.html), hosted [Troma Night](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/101723.html) while [Dan][dan] and [Claire][claire] were away, spotted [a ship](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/102143.html) in the bay, and sent [greetings from Italy](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/102354.html).
