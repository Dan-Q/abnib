In April 2009:

* [Andy R][andy-r] bought [ten CDs](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/the-last-ten-cds-i-bought/), found [spammers](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/bless-spammers/) endearing, found a new [favourite band](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/ten-cities-videointernet-forever/), released another [weekly video](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/10/this-weeks-video/), re-released [an old EP](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/make-archive-2001-2005/), performed ['England Expects'](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/england-expects-video/) on YouTube, released [mis-titled MP3s](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/fight-my-battle-sic-for-me-out-now-digitally/), and found [a niche](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/mass-interview/) in music journalism and exploited it to ask artists about how important [originality](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/mass-interview-question-1-originality/) is to them, whether  [lyrics](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/mass-interview-question-2-lyrics/) have to communicate something, how their [background](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/mass-interview-question-3-background/) has influenced their music, whether [innovation](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/mass-interview-question-4-innovation/) is still possible, and whether there are any '[golden rules](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/mass-interview-question-5-golden-rules/)' to music success.

* [Bryn][bryn] shared a video about [domestic violence](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2009/04/02/cut-movie/).

* [Claire][claire] reported back on her efforts to [buy no clothes](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2009/04/no-clothes-for-a-year/) for a year, and - as an April Fool - announced that she was converting to Buddhism.

* [Dan][dan] discovered that [he can't change the weather](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/08/smiling-in-shorts/), shared a picture of [Claire][claire] with [the Red Dwarf crew](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/08/claire-and-the-dwarfers/), noted the [bins laden](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/09/terrorist-threat-affects-refuse-collection/) problem, was [visited](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/16/aber-visitors/) by [Penny][penny], [Andy R][andy-r], [Sian][sian], [Jen][jen], Nick, [Matt P][matt-p], [Andy K][andy-k], Faye, and others (many of them for [Adam W][adam-w]'s birthday), [sprained his ankle](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/27/ankle/) while chasing cake, and [used a Venn diagram](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/04/29/an-xkcd-moment/) to work out which webcomic he was talking about with [Ruth][ruth].

* [Ele][ele] felt sad about [not being in Aber](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/7497.html), and considered doing a Masters.

* [Jen][jen] felt [very happy](http://scleip.livejournal.com/58581.html), and looked forward to her marriage to Nick.

* [JTA][jta] finally got [Ruth][ruth]'s much-belated [Christmas present](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/01/awesome/), recommended [a blog](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/03/i-love-the-smell-of-coaligned-opinions-in-the-morning/), hunted [Easter eggs](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/14/i-shouldve-gone-to-bed-but-the-whisky-isnt-gone/), turned 24, tried to [fix public transport](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/16/a-highly-articulate-outburst/), (literally) [flooded the car](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/27/hum-2/), and contemplated how [his stubbornness](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/04/29/backing-music-by-jethro-tull-why-not/) can be seen to stem from the sudden death of his father, twelve years prior.

* [Matt P][matt-p] got back [from Johannesburg](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/45148.html) (albeit without his luggage).

* [Paul][paul] began [a spat with PayPal](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2009/04/11/beware-paypal/) after they ruled against him (as the seller) in an online auction.

* [Rory][rory] planned for [his 28th birthday](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/106890.html) to be celebrated in Little Italy.
