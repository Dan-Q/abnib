A since-deleted post by [Adam G][adam-g] talked about nostalgia for Aberystwyth, kicking off a string of posts by other Abnibbers about what they missed about the place (as well as posts by those who were still there!). Also in September 2010:

* [Adam G][adam-g] wrote poems about [a shoe](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/lonely-shoe/) and [a rocking horse](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/horsing-around/).

* [Andy R][andy-r] announced [Brainlove tickets](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/tickets/), and released [some B-sides](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/a-neuron-poem-soon/).

* [Bryn][bryn] caught everybody up with [what he'd been up to](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/09/14/dal-lan-catching-up/) lately, and [looked back](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2010/09/17/symud-mlaen-moving-on/) on Aberystwyth (and why he didn't miss it).

* [Claire][claire] went on [holiday](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2010/09/holiday/) with [Jimmy][jimmy] and talked about being ['stuck' in Aber](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2010/09/nostalgias-not-what-it-used-to-be/).
