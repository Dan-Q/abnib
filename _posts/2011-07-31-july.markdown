In July 2011:

* [Adam G][adam-g] wrote poetry about [going shopping with his wife](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/top-of-the-shops/) and [putting a bird feeder up](http://adrokspoems.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/79/).

* [Andy R][andy-r] continued his "PWL re-issues" blog series with "[The Aberystwyth Cliff Railway Disaster 1902](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/boxedset08-1902/)" and sought [talented people](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/job-vacancies/) to help him with a PWL-related project.

* [Dan][dan] discovered the joy of [Halloumi & Mushroom Skewers](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/07/01/halloumi-mushroom-skewers/), and recalled the time he [first juggled with flaming clubs](http://www.scatmania.org/2011/07/09/on-this-day-in-2003-2/).

* [Ele][ele] had [an awful last day at her job](http://ele-is-crazy.livejournal.com/9259.html), but had lots of new things going on in her life, to compensate.

* [Jen][jen] wrote a poem [about carbon](http://scleip.livejournal.com/59422.html).

* [Kit][kit] and [Fiona][fiona] watched [the summer fly by](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/another-summer-zooming-by/) from the back of a tandem.

* ['Malbo21'][malbo21] accidentally almost brought down their organisational head... [using sushi](http://malbo21.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/sushi-and-downfall/).

* [Paul][paul]'s workplace was [raided](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/07/02/booker-raid/), and he subsequently had to wear [a personal alarm](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2011/07/19/tagged/) while there.

* [Sian][sian] had a weekend of [hula-hooping](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/hooping-it-up/), reflected on her [30 by 30 list](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/07/10/life-death-harry-potter/), and considered [running away to join the circus](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/running-away-with-the-circus/).
