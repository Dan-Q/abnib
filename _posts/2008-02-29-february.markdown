In February 2008:

* [Adam W][adam-w] spotted an [ironically-placed advertisement](http://www.ad-space.org.uk/2008/02/27/falling-standards/) in the Cambrian News.

* Gareth brought [Bryn][bryn] a [gift from Kazakhstan](http://randomlyevil.org.uk/2008/02/08/a-gift-from-kazakhstan/).

* [Claire][claire] wrote [some songs](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/02/songs-written-at-the-ski-slopes/) while skiing in Bulgarian with [Dan][dan], then returned to find that, [one of her rats had died](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2008/02/do-not-read-if-squeamish/).

* [Dan][dan] went to [Bulgaria](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/02/off-to-bulgaria/), where he [used an Internet cafe](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/04/in-bulgaria/) and expensive GPRS, to report on he and [Claire][claire]'s [skiing](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/06/news-from-the-slopes/), and [skidooing](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/13/and-the-rest-of-bulgaria/), before coming home and celebrating [Valentine's Day](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/15/valentines-day/) with [Ruth][ruth] and [JTA][jta]. His [PC died](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/15/aw-shit/), which didn't help when he had to investigate why the Arts Centre website's dates were in [an unusual language](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/20/best-bug-ever/), received [a postcard](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/21/a-postcard-from-jimmy/) from [Jimmy][jimmy] in Thailand, got [addicted](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/22/gotta-play-one-more-level/) to a Flash game, and laughed at the suggesting of 'marking' [self-harm awareness day](http://www.scatmania.org/2008/02/26/self-harm-awareness-day/).

* [Jimmy][jimmy] arrived in [Bangkok](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/26563.html) where he [rode a moped](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/26796.html) and [celebrated the full moon](http://vikingjim.livejournal.com/27055.html) while getting soaked by rain.

* As [Claire][claire] and [Dan][dan] were in Bulgaria, [JTA][jta] announced that [Troma Night would be happening](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2008/02/02/troma-as-i-believe-these-things-tend-to-get-called-announce/) at [Rory][rory]'s place.

* [Kit][kit] looked back on [his relatively-tame youth](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/nightshift/), rented [a car](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/backshift/) while his and [Fiona][fiona]'s was being repaired, did battle with [the stereo](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/numberplates-bees-and-rock-and-roll/) in the car, and recommended [a radio play](http://reaperkit.wordpress.com/2008/02/26/when-greed-becomes-fear/) inspired by the looming financial crisis.

* [Matt P][matt-p] celebrated [his birthday](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/33120.html) amidst job applications and interviews, and had a post-op [rectal examination](http://myzelik.livejournal.com/33348.html).

* [Matt R][matt-r] solicited [votes](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/44858.html) for Pagan Wanderer Lu, commented on a news story that claimed that [terrorist attacks on Britain are caused by a lack of national identity](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/45255.html), and joked about [Price Harry's redeployment](http://matt-inthe-hat.livejournal.com/45459.html).

* [Paul][paul] hoped to get [giant microbes](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2008/02/07/giant-microbes/) for his birthday.
