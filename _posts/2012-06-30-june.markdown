* [Paul][paul] went on holiday to Jura with [Kit][kit] and [Fiona][fiona], and provided [a](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/02/holiday-to-jura-day-one-saturday/), [very](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/03/holiday-to-jura-day-two-sunday/), [long](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/03/holiday-to-jura-day-three-monday/), [and](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/04/holiday-to-jura-day-five-wednesday/), [thorough](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/04/holiday-to-jura-day-four-tuesday/), [series](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/05/holiday-to-jura-day-six-thursday/), [of](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/06/holiday-to-jura-day-seven-friday/), [posts](http://blog.pacifist.co.uk/2012/06/09/holiday-to-jura-day-eight-saturday/) about the entire trip.
